# PyModule 4: How to Build Neural Networks in Python
In this module, we will show how to build a neural netowkr in Python and the basics on how they can be used.
 
## Objectives
By the end of this course, our goal is for you to learn how to start using the Python Programming Language in Health Science professions. This includes:

- Understanding how computer code allows humans to talk to computers
- Learning the concrete process for using computer code and Python
- Becoming familiar with the process of writing in Python
- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools
- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare
- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare

Keep these goals in mind as you go through the module and the course. If you feel like you are struggling to understand these concepts, feel free to ask questions. W would be happy to help before you move on to the next topic. 

## Reading
Before starting the Studio session, read the following:

["Introduction to Statistical Thought: Chapter 3"](_refs/IntroStatisticalThought.pdf)   
["Introduction to Keras-Deep Learning Library: Medium"](_refs/IntroKerasMedium.pdf)   
["Teaching Python to Healthcare Workers"](_refs/PythonHCWorkers.pdf)

If you dont understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Videos
Before starting the Studio session, watch the following:

["How to Talk to Computers: Part 4"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fzBGgflXk8&t=4s)   
["Finding Data from Natural Experiments: Causal Inference Bootcamp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=y9kRenmqIkg)   
["Neural Network in 5 Minutes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfmFfD2RIcg)

If you do not understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Studio
In each module, you will complete a studio session with your team. The goal of the studio is to give you hands on experience writing Python code and using Data Science tools that are important for health science.

Refer to the "About Studios" page on how to access the notebooks, what to expect in the studio session, and which track to follow.

## Discussion
After completing the readings and videos in the module, answer the following questions with your team. 

1. In "How to Talk to Computers" the narrator uses four steps for doing an analysis in Python. Do you think this sturcture is helpful or would you prefer to use a different set of steps in your code?
2. In "" the narrator states that 
3. In "Introduction to Statistical Thought" the author discusses the use of displays and models to show a relationshop between variables. Think of an analysis that you would like to do in Python. What ways would you show the relationship?
4. In the videos and readings, you can see that the mathematical concepts for Data Science can be very advanced, but the code is much simpler to write. Since you can't learn everything, what things do you have to understand about the math in order to use a model appropriately?

Be sure that everyone answers each question and responds to at least one answer from another team member. 

## Reflection
After completing the studio session please pick one or two of the following questions to discuss with your team. 

1. What was something new that you learned in this module?
2. What was something that you knew previously but heard differently in this module?
3. What was something that understand better after this module?
4. What was something that is confusing after this module?

Each team member may select a different question, but be sure that everyone provides a refelction and responds to another's reflection.
