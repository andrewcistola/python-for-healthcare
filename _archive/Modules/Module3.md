# Module 3: How to Use Machine Learning in Python
In this module, we will go over the basics of conducting statistical tests, using machine learning algorithms, and interpreting results in Python. 

## Objectives
By the end of this course, our goal is for you to learn how to start using the Python Programming Language in Health Science professions. This includes:

- Understanding how computer code allows humans to talk to computers
- Learning the concrete process for using computer code and Python
- Becoming familiar with the process of writing in Python
- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools
- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare
- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare

Keep these goals in mind as you go through the module and the course. If you feel like you are struggling to understand these concepts, feel free to ask questions. W would be happy to help before you move on to the next topic. 

## Reading
Before starting the Studio session, read the following:

["Introduction to Statistical Thought: Chapter 1"](_refs/IntroStatisticalThought.pdf)   
["An Intro to Scikit Learn: Medium"](_refs/IntroScikitLearnMedium.pdf)   
["Python as a First Programming Language for Biomedical Scientists"](_refs/FirstforBiomedical.pdf)

If you dont understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Videos
Before starting the Studio session, watch the following:

["How to Talk to Computers: Part 3"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fzBGgflXk8&t=4s)   
["What is the Point of Statistical Inference?": Causal Inference Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IOzq0hOttY)   
["AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPUWwpocc1c)

If you do not understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Studio
In each module, you will complete a studio session with your team. The goal of the studio is to give you hands on experience writing Python code and using Data Science tools that are important for health science.

Refer to the "README" page on how to access the notebooks, what to expect in the studio session, and which track to follow.

## Discussion
After completing the readings and videos in the module, answer the following questions with your team. 

1. In "How to Talk to Computers" the narrator shows a few different programs that you can use to write and run code. What experience have you had with programs like these? What was that experience like for you?
2. In "AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science" the narrator states that all of these fields intersect and term s can be used interchangably. What terms are confusing for you? What is an analogy you could use to explain the differences that may be helpful?
3. In "Introduction to Statistical Thought" the author discusses many different aspects of probability in Statistics. Think of an example of a probability distribution in your own healthcare profession that you would like to study. What question would you want to answer based on the data?
4. In the videos and readings, you can see that Data Science invovles both statistics and programming. What do you feel more comfortable with and why? What makes each practice easier to learn for you?

Be sure that everyone answers each question and responds to at least one answer from another team member. 

## Reflection
After completing the studio session please pick one or two of the following questions to discuss with your team. 

1. What was something new that you learned in this module?
2. What was something that you knew previously but heard differently in this module?
3. What was something that understand better after this module?
4. What was something that is confusing after this module?

Each team member may select a different question, but be sure that everyone provides a refelction and responds to another's reflection.
