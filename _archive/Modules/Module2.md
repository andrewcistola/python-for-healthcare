# Module 2: How to Work with Data in Python
In this module, we will go over the basics of writing a code script in Python for collecting and manipulating data. 

## Objectives
By the end of this course, our goal is for you to learn how to start using the Python Programming Language in Health Science professions. This includes:

- Understanding how computer code allows humans to talk to computers
- Learning the concrete process for using computer code and Python
- Becoming familiar with the process of writing in Python
- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools
- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare
- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare

Keep these goals in mind as you go through the module and the course. If you feel like you are struggling to understand these concepts, feel free to ask questions. W would be happy to help before you move on to the next topic. 

## Reading
Before starting the Studio session, read the following:

["Python for Everybody: Chapter 2"](_refs/PythonEverybody.pdf)   
["A Quick Introduction to the Pandas Python Library: Medium"](_refs/IntroDSPandas.pdf)   
["My Experience Learning Python"](_refs/MyExperiencePython.pdf)

If you dont understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Videos
Before starting the Studio session, watch the following:

["How to Talk to Computers: Part 2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw6bWACGybo)   
["pandas Foundations: DataCamp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyIN3SE11V0)   
["Types of errors and how to fix them"](https://youtu.be/_Nrj6Njfzp4)

If you do not understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Studio
In each module, you will complete a studio session with your team. The goal of the studio is to give you hands on experience writing Python code and using Data Science tools that are important for health science. 

[PyStudio 2: Building a Model](Studios/Studio2.ipynb)

Refer to the "About Studios" page on how to access the notebooks, what to expect in the studio session, and which track to follow.

## Discussion
After completing the readings and videos in the module, answer the following questions with your team. 

1. In "How to Talk to Computers" the narrator states that writing code is like writing poetry. If you have ever written poetry (or song lyrics) in the past, what were the rules or structures you used? Did those rules make it easier or harder to write as well as understand others writing?
2. In "My Experience Learning Python" the author talks about transition from SPSS (which uses a graphical interface) to Python. What ebenfits did the author give in making the transition? What benefits do you hope to get from learning Python?
3. In "Python for Everybody" the author states that you "have a lot of choice when you name your variables." In Python you can write code in many different ways. What kinds of habits do you think would be important when writing code so that others could follow what you are writing?
4. In the videos and readings, you can see that people learn Python in different ways. What are the kinds of things that will help you learn Python?

Be sure that everyone answers each question and responds to at least one answer from another team member. 

## Reflection
After completing the studio session please pick one or two of the following questions to discuss with your team. 

1. What was something new that you learned in this module?
2. What was something that you knew previously but heard differently in this module?
3. What was something that understand better after this module?
4. What was something that is confusing after this module?

Each team member may select a different question, but be sure that everyone provides a refelction and responds to another's reflection.
