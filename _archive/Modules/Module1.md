# Module 1: How to Talk to Computers in Python

In this module you will learn the basics of what computer code is and how best to think about learning to write code in the Python Programming Language. 

## Objectives
By the end of this course, our goal is for you to learn how to start using the Python Programming Language in Health Science professions. This includes:

- Understanding how computer code allows humans to talk to computers
- Learning the concrete process for using computer code and Python
- Becoming familiar with the process of writing in Python
- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools
- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare
- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare

Keep these goals in mind as you go through the module and the course. If you feel like you are struggling to understand these concepts, feel free to ask questions. W would be happy to help before you move on to the next topic. 

## Reading
Before starting the Studio session, read the following:

["Python for Everybody: Chapter 1"](_refs/PythonEverybody.pdf)   
["A beginner's guide to Data Science with Python: Medium"](_refs/IntroDSMedium.pdf)   
["Code to Joy: The Economist's 1843 Magazine"](_refs/CodetoJoy.pdf)

If you dont understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Videos
Before starting the Studio session, watch the following:

["How to Talk to Computers: Part 1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fzBGgflXk8&t=4s)   
["What is Data Science: DataCamp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuLnpdHee4)   
["How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OZip0cgOho)

If you do not understand every part, that is ok. Use these resources to get familair with the concepts.

## Studio
In each module, you will complete a studio session with your team. The goal of the studio is to give you hands on experience writing Python code and using Data Science tools that are important for health science. 

[PyStudio 1: Learning the Basics](Studios/Studio1.ipynb)   

Refer to the "README" page on how to access the notebooks, what to expect in the studio session, and which track to follow. 

## Discussion
After completing the readings and videos in the module, answer the following questions with your team. 

1. In the "Code to Joy" article, the author shares the experience of learning to code without any previous experience. What parts of that reflection did you resonate with and why?
2. In "How to Talk to Computers: Part 1" the narrator states that "learning to code is like learning any other human language." If you have ever learned a second langauge, what was that experience like? What parts of learning a new langauge were difficult and easy for you?
3. In "Python for Everybody" the author states that you need two skills to be a programmer: knwoing the programming langauge and "telling a story." In your opinion, how could writing in Python be like telling a story?
4. After seeing how Python and Data Science applies to many fields, what ways would you like to use Python in the future?

Be sure that everyone answers each question and responds to at least one answer from another team member. 

## Reflection
After completing the studio session please pick one or two of the following questions to discuss with your team. 

1. What was something new that you learned in this module?
2. What was something that you knew previously but heard differently in this module?
3. What was something that understand better after this module?
4. What was something that is confusing after this module?

Each team member may select a different question, but be sure that everyone provides a refelction and responds to another's reflection.
