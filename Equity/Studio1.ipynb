    "- Understanding how computer code allows humans to talk to computers\n",
    "- Learning the concrete process for using computer code and Python\n",
    "- Becoming familiar with the process of writing in Python\n",
    "- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools\n",
    "- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare\n",
    "- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare\n",
