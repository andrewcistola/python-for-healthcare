# PyModule 1: How to Talk to Computers
In this module, you will learn the basics of what computer code is and how best to think about learning to write code.

## Objectives
Module: Learn how to start using the Python Programming Language
- Understand how computer code allows humans to talk to computers
- Learn the concrete process for using computer code and Python
- Become familiar with the process of writing in Python
Course: Learn how the Python Programming Language can be used in a Healthcare context. 
- Identify healthcare questions that can be answered with open source data science tools
- Experience how Python can be used to answer questions related to healthcare
- Increase awareness of how Python can be used in a future career in healthcare

## Reading
"Code to Joy" from The Economist's 1843 Magazine

## Studio
### PyStudio 1: Self-Compose Your Own Script
In our first studio session, you will be using a model script to compose your very own Python script. While this may sound daunting, we are going to do something very easy: copy my script exactly
Here is how it will work:
1. Download the PDF version of my model script below.
2. Open a text editor (any text editor will work just fine but Notepad for Windows and TextEdit for Mac OSX are best)
3. Save your script as "name_model_code". Be sure to use your first name in place of "name."
4. Open both my screen shot and your text editor side by side. 
5. Copy the entire script EXACTLY as you see it on the screen. 
6. Submit your final script to the assignment before you leave the session
Why this is important.
While copying may not seem like a helpful activity, this process is one of the most important of the course. Learning to speak a language  involves a lot of repetition and learning an instrument involves muscle memory. This is our way of mimicking that process and allowing you get the feel and structure of how Python works. 
Also, most art students start learning by copying what other artists have already done. While this seems a little like cheating, it is a great way to learn a new skill really quickly.  Also, once you type it out yourself you can claim it as your own script (just be sure to give credit to where you got the original). 
To be clear, I will have no way of knowing that someone did not just copy and paste it for you. Since the goal is to get you up to speed quickly and not give a grade, I hope that you wont miss this chance to learn. 

## Assessment
### PyModule 1: Lecture & Reading Quiz
After completing the articles and videos in the module, answer the following questions. Be sure to examine the questions and module materials carefully, the questions are taken directly from article and video content. 
1. Learning to code is similar to learning any other _______________________
2. According to "Code to Joy", the author stated that "at first the litany of names sounded like ______________"
3. When using code to talk to a computer, you will often write a ___________ and then run selected text in a ____________

### PyModule 1: Team Reflections
After reading the selected articles, watching the module videos, taking the quiz, and completing the studio session please answer ONE of the following questions.
After your individual post, respond to each other team member sharing points of similarity or difference in your experience. Length or style is not important.
1. What was something new that you learned in this module?
2. What was something that you knew previously but heard differently in this module?
3. What do you understand better after this module?
4. What is more confusing after this module?
