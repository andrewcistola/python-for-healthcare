## Welcome to Python for Healthcare!
This is a learning experience designed to teach the basics of using the Python Programming Language for data science in a healthcare setting. You do not need to have any experience with computers to participate and we welcome individuals from any background.

## What is in this Course
This course consists of a few learning elements designed to help you quickly get up to speed on using Python. These experiences include:

### PyModules 
Just like any other online or blended classroom, there are four modules that contain the information you will need to complete the tasks for that week. These modules include readings, videos, and a comprehension quiz. 

### PyStudio
During each module, we will take 1 hour to work on a project together. This time will include a brief introduction and then teams will be given time to complete the task and work together in groups. During this time, you will have a chance to ask questions of each other and the instructor. There is a link on the homepage for detailed instructions.

### PyProject
During this learning experience, you will be working on your own project with a dataset that you select yourself. This is the final deliverable for the course and should reflect a topic of interest of use to you. This is also a great time to work on a research topic that may be used for an ongoing project outside of the course. There is a link on the home page with detailed instructions. 

### PyForum
During this experience, there may be questions that you have that you would like to ask the instructor or the group. The forum is a safe space to answer any and all questions about data, code, or using Python. The questions and answers are open for others in the group to see so everyone can learn and use them for reference. 

## Grading and Assessment
This course is not graded for accuracy or perfection, only participation. All of the content is designed to help you get up to speed quickly and selected for your own benefit. We made a due effort to not include anything not truly necessary to learning Python so it is import to participate in all the content. As long as you focus and give an honest effort, full grades are awarded to everyone that participates.
